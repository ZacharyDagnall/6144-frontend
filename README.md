Doably Stretchy
  ** (can i find a way to have the user select an emoji to play with as their token? 
     Easy on the inside of my js to pass the code for the emoji around, but how to receive the input?) **

Maybe:
** BattleShip
** Memory

*** refactor / put some repeat code into methods !
*** put repeat methods into index.js instead of in the individual games
***** rename similarly named methods


** in Connect 4, doesnt register a *lose* immediately, waits until next click... why?

** "this game's scores' shouldn't include open games right? need to fix
**** can we also change this to be the top 10 scores only, from high to low?

** make a nice readme
** now we need music

*** add to heroku
