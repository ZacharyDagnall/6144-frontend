# Game Boyz Arcade

## Introduction
Game Boyz Arcade was written as a phase 3 project for the Flatiron School Engineering program as a Single-page Web-app with a Ruby on Rails API backend. The back end API can be found [here](https://github.com/ZacharyDagnall/GameBoyzArcade-backend). 

Within the app, a user can sign in using their name. There is no current authentication implemented. If a username matching the entered text has been saved to the database previously, their games will be loaded. If the username does not exist, a new user will be created. 

Once logged on the user will be able to play any of the six games, each move will save your progress. If a user has a previous game open, the app will load that saved game when you click on the respective game. 

## Tic Tac Toe

A classic game of Tic Tac Toe! Click on a space on the board to place your tile "❌". The computer will then place it's tile "⭕". See if you can outsmart the computer!

## 6144

This game is 2048 but using an additive three instead of two. Use your arrow keys to move all the tiles on the board. Combine matching numbers to add them together, but be careful, when you make a move a new 3 or 6 will appear on the board. The game is over when you have no available moves. See if you can reach the 6144 tile. 

## Fibinacci tiles

Up for a challenge? Try Fibinacci Tiles, a new twist on 6144. Use your arrow keys to move all the tiles on the board. Two tiles will only combine when they add up to a Fibinacci number. Can you reach 6765?

## Connect 4

Connect 4 now arrives to Game Boyz Arcade! Click anywhere on the board to drop a token in a slot. The computer will then drop it's token. Win by having four tokens line up vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. 

## Lights Out!

An enLIGHTening puzzle game. Click on a tile on the board to turn it and its nieghbors on and off. Watch out though, every click costs you 25 points; you'll game over if you run out of points! Can you light up the whole board in time? 

## Bug Mode?

Uh-oh! This version of 6144 wasnt ment to be pushed yet, its riddled with bugs!! Maybe you can help us de-bug it? The game plays like 6144: use your arrow keys to move all the tiles on the board and combine matching numbers to add them together. See if you can figure out how to squash those bugs!
