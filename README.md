TO-DO list
* what to do when game over, after alert is closed (doesn't quite work right now?) 
** take a look at logout button from connect 4 
** sleep gameover alert
** Fix open game scores showing


Doably Stretchy
  ** (can i find a way to have the user select an emoji to play with as their token? 
     Easy on the inside of my js to pass the code for the emoji around, but how to receive the input?) **

Maybe:
** BattleShip
** Memory

*** refactor / put some repeat code into methods !
*** put repeat methods into index.js instead of in the individual games
***** rename similarly named methods



Zak:
** in Connect 4, doesnt register a lose immediately, waits until next click... why?

**** adjust probability of bugs

** "this game's scores' shouldn't include open games right? need to fix

** add game over method to bugsoff (and others?)
** sleep before game over alerts

** make a nice readme
** now we need music

*** add to heroku
